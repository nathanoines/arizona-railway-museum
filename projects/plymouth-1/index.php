                        <h3>Build History</h3>
                        <p>Built in a group of 24 locomotives for the U.S. War Department, serial numbers 4441 to 4464, this serial number 4463 was the last member of the group delivered on March 26, 1943. It was assigned number US 7595, and stationed at the Army Air Corp's Victorville Advanced Flying School, in Victorville CA.</p>

                        <p>In November 1966, it was sold to private company M. Lummis & Co of Richmond CA. It was later owned by Pacific Railroad Contractors of Torrance CA, and finally Railroad Builders of Mira Loma CA, who donated the locomotive to the museum in 1988.</p>

                        <p>Unlike many of this type that have been refitted with a diesel engine, this Plymouth ML-8 locomotive still has the original Leroi Model RX1V, 250-HP, V8 gasoline engine with a displacement of 2008 cubic inches. Power is transmitted to the wheels via a clutch and 4-speed mechanical transmission, with chain drive to the axles.</p>

                        <p>The locomotive was cosmetically and functionally restored by museum volunteers. In 2005, in honor of the locomotive's long-term caretaker, it was named the <strong>"George E. Holt"</strong>.</p>

                        <h3>Recent History</h3>
                        <p>For many years after its restoration, the locomotive was maintained in operating condition, and was used frequently for switching cars on the museum grounds. Unfortunately, in April 2011, the integral air compressor failed, which caused extensive collateral damage to the engine's front gear casing and radiator.</p>

                        <p>Work is underway to make the necessary repairs and return the locomotive to service. The museum has purchased two stationary Leroi engines that were originally used to power cotton gins, which will serve as a parts source for the Plymouth's engine.</p>

                                            <strong>September 07:</strong> Installed a 'bee cap' (a.k.a. baked bean can) on the open end of the pipe leading to the air reservoir.
                                        </li>

                                            <strong>August 31:</strong> Painted the two oil filler caps. No bees observed this week.
                                        </li>
                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem; padding-bottom: 1rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
                                            <strong>August 24:</strong> Primer-painted the two oil filler caps. Scraped more gunk from the engine, this time deep inside the 'V' of the engine block. No one had been down there in a VERY long time! Noted a large number of bees around the locomotive, concentrated near the open pipe on the main reservoir.
                                        </li>
                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem; padding-bottom: 1rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
                                            <strong>August 17:</strong> Scraped and degreased a thick layer of crud from the two oil filler caps, and scraped more gunk from the engine and frame.
                                        </li>
                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem; padding-bottom: 1rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
                                            <strong>July 27:</strong> Applied sealant to the remaining three valve covers. Also installed 'rain caps' (a.k.a. baked bean cans) to the four valve cover breathers. A perfect fit! A small amount of water was drained from the crankcase. Scraped more gunk.
                                        </li>
                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem; padding-bottom: 1rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
                                            <strong>July 20:</strong> During a routine check for water in the crankcase, a LOT of water was discovered in the crankcase. Fortunately, a 'sniff test' revealed it to be rainwater, not coolant. Applied sealant to one of the valve covers in an effort to prevent water getting in the engine. Scraped much gunk from the engine.
                                        </li>
                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem; padding-bottom: 1rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
                                            <strong>June 22:</strong> Did more filing on the crankshaft. Reinstalled the pulley hub, using a combination to steel plates, threaded rod and nuts to 'pull' the hub onto the crankshaft. This was done to avoid pushing on the crankshaft, which could have damaged the bearings. Despite applying much force, the pulley hub did not seem to engage farther onto the crankshaft than before.
                                        </li>
                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem; padding-bottom: 1rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
                                            <strong>June 15:</strong> Removed the pulley hub from the crankshaft, and found some 'lumps' in the surface of the crankshaft, which might be interfering with the complete engagement of the hub on the shaft. Some filing was done on the offending parts of the crankshaft, but more is needed.
                                        </li>
                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem; padding-bottom: 1rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
                                            <strong>May 25:</strong> Disconnected the caburetor's air intake hose, choke cable, throttle linkage, fuel line and vacuum bypass connection. Also turned off the fuel valve located at the base of the air cleaner. Removed the carburetor, cleaned its exterior, and began disassembly of the major components. Cleaned the gasketed surfaces. Discovered that the idle jet is damaged.
                                        </li>
                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem; padding-bottom: 1rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
                                            <strong>May:</strong> Straightened up the cab interior, and hosed-off the exterior in preparation for National Train Day. For the day of the event, the cab doors were open for viewing, but no access to the cab was allowed. The tarp was removed from the engine so visitors could see the progress.
                                        </li>
                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem; padding-bottom: 1rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
                                            <strong>April:</strong> Purchased a $209 carburetor rebuild kit #CS1065 from the Carburetor Shop of Eldon Missouri, which includes several gaskets, screws, washers, and a needle valve seat. Also obtained a 1944 War Department Technical Manual TM 9-1826C, Ordnance Maintenance, Carburetors (Zenith), which contains pertinent information on the Zenith 1510MV carburetor.
                                        </li>
                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem; padding-bottom: 1rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e0e0e0;">
                                            <strong>March:</strong> Installed the packing-retaining ring around the pulley hub. Used two layers of ¼" square Graphite packing to seal around the pulley hub. Installed the pulley hub on the crankshaft, but it doesn't seem to go on far enough. At this point it is uncertain whether the parts are just being stubborn, or if there is a compatibility issue. Research continues on a replacement air compressor.<br><br>
                                            Sent an inquiry to Zenith Fuel Systems regarding the carburetor. They do not have parts but did send a service manual. Also sent an inquiry to another company advertising a kit for the carburetor, but haven't received a response yet.<br><br>
                                            Posted Plymouth ML6/ML8 Catalog, Roiline Engine Manual, and Zenith Carburetor Manual to the website's Technical Library. The catalog is also posted on the Project Page.

                                            <strong>February:</strong> The locomotive was moved to the north side of the crossing to facilitate welding of the damaged crankshaft keyway. The keyway was repaired by welding and grinding. Self-adhesive cork was used to fabricate a new gasket for the gear cover. The gear cover was successfully transplanted on the locomotive's engine. Everything seems to line up okay.

                                            <strong>January:</strong> Removed the pulley hub from Texas engine #2, and found it to be in much better condition than the one from engine #1. The hub was cleaned and painted. Significant damage to the keyway on the Plymouth's crankshaft was discovered. This needs to be addressed before the gear cover can be installed. Installed two new engine mounting bolts and added US and Arizona flags.

                                            <strong>December:</strong> Refurbishment of the 'new' gear cover is complete. Several minor issues remain before it can be installed on the engine. The oil splash-ring needs to be modified to fit the Plymouth's engine, a pulley hub seal needs to be fabricated, and a bottom-edge gasket needs to be cut. Investigation is also underway to determine if the pulley hub on the other Texas engine is in better condition. Removed the two front engine mounting bolts, which were loose. These will be replaced.

                                            <strong>November:</strong> The pulley, pulley hub, and the gear cover were removed from one of the 'Texas' engines and test fit on the Plymouth's engine. All holes seem to line up properly, and the front end of the crankshaft appears to be the same on both engines. Cosmetic restoration of the 'new' gear cover is underway before final mounting on the Plymouth's engine.

                                            After much deliberation, the decision was made to purchase one of two LeRoi engines located in Temple Texas. The engines are stationary types previously used to power cotton gins. They are for sale by a private owner for $350 each. The plan is to use one of the flat gear covers to replace the extended gear cover on the Plymouth.

                                            <strong>December:</strong> Some new history on the locomotive has been obtained! Plymouth Locomotive Serial Number 4463 was purchased by the War Department on March 26 1943, and was stationed at the Army Air Corp's Victorville Advanced Flying School, in Victorville CA, as US Army #7595. The assignment lasted from the time of its original purchase until being sold to private company M. Lummis & Co of Richmond CA in November 1966. It was later owned by Pacific Railroad Contractors of Torrance CA, and finally Railroad Builders of Mira Loma CA before being donated to the museum in 1988. The LeRoi RXIV engine is rated at 250 HP.<br><br>

                                            <strong>April 17:</strong> By opening the top lid of the air compressor, it was evident that the exhaust valve failed, which caused the valve to fall down into the compressor cylinder, jamming the piston and breaking the connecting rod. The broken rod whipped around and shattered the huge cast iron piece on the front of the engine. This casting 1) covers the timing gears, 2) supports the bearings for the crankshaft extension that powers the compressor, 3) supports the compressor body, and 4) supports the fan shaft. It no longer performs any of these functions. Since the fan shaft was no longer supported, the fan tipped forward and sliced into the radiator, destroying most of the core sections. This was the source of the leaking coolant.<br><br>

                                            <strong>April 16:</strong> While performing routine switching in the yard, a drop in air pressure was noted, quickly followed by a horrible crashing and banging noise from the engine compartment. The engine was immediately shut down. Several chunks of cast iron were laying on the ground beneath the front of the engine, and the air compressor's broken connecting rod was seen hanging down. A large amount of coolant was leaking.

                                            <strong>June 05:</strong> Drained the crankcase, replaced the drain valve, and filled the crankcase with SAE 30 non-detergent oil. Replaced the two oil filters. The old oil, while dirty, was not nearly as bad as the oil that was drained out on the last oil change several years ago. Started the engine after the oil change, and noted a few minor oil leaks at the fittings on the small oil lines.<br><br>
                                            After checking with Pittsburgh Air Brake, discovered that the gasket for the self-lapping unit is correct. It just didn't look right (from the outside) since the gaskets fits in between the studs, rather than around the studs as with most gaskets. The new gasket still needs installation.

                                            <strong>April 30:</strong> Installed a new pipe bracket gasket (Wabco p/n 92428) on the SA-2 Independent Brake Valve. The old gasket was very brittle and cracked. Also attempted to replace the gasket for the Self-Lapping Unit, but the gasket ordered was the wrong type. Evidently we have a variation or modification of the SA-2 valve not documented in the Wabco literature we have. Must investigate further, but for now, the old gasket seems to be holding okay.<br><br>
                                            In preparation for National Train Day, the Plymouth was used to pull the Baldwin into position for horn-blowing (i.e. away from other display equipment) and to pull-out the caboose for train rides.

                                            Purchased 48 quarts of SAE 30, Type SB non-detergent motor oil (40 quarts for the crankcase, and another eight quarts for future replenishment). However, it was decided to wait a few weeks before changing the oil and filters, since we also want to replace the oil pan drain valve at the same time.

                                            <strong>April 17:</strong> Added about ½-gallon of antifreeze to the radiator, but more is needed. Since only plain water has been added to the radiator in recent times, the next few additions will be pure antifreeze to restore the proper concentration. This may help with the boiling-over problem.<br><br>
                                            Changed the fuel filter, NAPA 4347. Also purchased two replacement oil filters (NAPA 1503), but installation will wait until we do the oil change.

                                            <strong>January 30:</strong> Added 3 quarts of oil to the crankcase and about a gallon of water to the radiator. The handle fell off the crankcase drain when I attempted to drain the crankcase condensation. The handle was put back on (actually found the screw in the ballast!), but this valve should probably be replaced on the next oil change.<br><br>
                                            Pulled out the '714 caboose and parked the train just north of the crossing, in preparation for the next day's meeting. Hosed and wiped down the cab interior, and hosed the undercarriage.

                                            <strong>January 24:</strong> Reinstalled all the components of the air compressor. Started the engine, and the air pressure ran up to 110 lbs at which time the unloader valve functioned as intended. Pressure dropped to 90 lbs and then the compressor loaded again. This is the best air pressure we have had in many years. The previous maximum of only 70-80 lbs was caused by the gradually eroding valve seat on the old compressor exhaust valve.<br><br>
                                            The higher air pressure did wonders for the sound of the bell: now it goes DING DING instead of dink dink.<br><br>
                                            Observed that the fuel level was down to about 3 gallons. Over the following week, added five gallons at a time until the level was about 18 gallons, plus another 5 gallons 'emergency' fuel in the gas can.

                                            Received new exhaust valve springs from WC Machine.<br><br>
                                            Re-assembled the exhaust valve, using three springs facing in the same direction. Secured the assembly with a special Norlok lockwasher and a two-piece locking nut (for $17 each it'd better hold!)

                                            <strong>January 02:</strong> Verified that the suspect battery was #1 starting battery (installed September 2007). Connected the large battery charger to it, and immediately noticed a strong 'rotten eggs' odor. Not wanting to risk an acid boil-over or fire under the hood, attempts to charge the battery were discontinued. The bad battery was disconnected so that the trickle-charger could work on the other two good batteries. A later search of the internet yielded the confirmation that the rotten eggs odor is a definite sign of a bad battery.<br><br>
                                            Replaced the bulb on the trickle charger, as it had failed due to the large voltage drop in attempting charge the bad battery.

As the Baldwin failed to start, we used the Plymouth for extensive switching in the yard. The engine overheated after a particularly hard pull (the steam engine, diesel crane and two flatcars!), so it was shut down and allowed to cool. Another session of switching followed after about an hour and some added water.<br><br>Also observed, twice while pulling a heavy load in 1st gear, the gear shift lever vibrated out of position and the transmission de-coupled.

                                            <strong>July 18:</strong> Added one quart of oil to the crankcase and about ¾ gallons of water to the radiator. Started the engine and used the locomotive to pull out the Baldwin in preparation for starting.

                                            <strong>May 09:</strong> For National Train Day, the locomotive performed well pulling two cabooses, giving train rides to hundreds of families. We did have to let it cool down a few times due to overheating, and in fact it boiled-over as soon as the engine was shut down. Had some trouble re-starting the engine at one point – plenty of cranking but not even a cough. It was finally coaxed into started by opening the throttle almost all the way. This has happened before, and is probably a vapor-lock situation due to the very hot engine. The engine temperature reached nearly 200 degrees F, with the oil pressure dropping considerably due to thinning of the oil. Ambient temperature was over 100 degrees, which didn't help matters.<br><br>Thirteen gallons of fuel were used for the train rides. Based on the number of trips and the length of the run, this works out to about 0.4 miles per gallon. What a gas hog! Tank measured 40 gallons.

                                            <strong>May 08:</strong> Reassembled and tested the air compressor. Air pressure quickly climbed to 75 PSI, which is about as much as we get with the broken valve seat.<br><br>Dave Luca gave a polish to some of the plastic cab windows and rubbed-out some rust streaks below the cab windows. Dave also talked to our Window Crew about replacing some of the windows with glass as material becomes available from other projects. The rear louver-window adjuster was repaired by tightening the bracket and replacing the missing thumbscrew.<br><br>Washed the locomotive, inside & out.

                                            <strong>May 03:</strong> Removed the valve cover on the air compressor and found that the exhaust valve assembly had come apart, with the flapper ring and springs shattered. This time the bolt hole was too damaged to reuse, so a larger-sized helicoil (7/16-14) was installed to refurbish the threads. A new copper gasket was installed underneath the exhaust valve. The valve was reassembled with the new, larger hardware, using high temperature thread-locker, and special Norlok washers.<br><br>As the exhaust valve has been a continuing issue, and part of the valve seat is broken away, a drawing was made of the cast metal valve base, in case we decide to fabricate a new one in the future. Research continues to determine the manufacturer of the air compressor – the logo on it does not look like a LeRoi mark.

                                            <strong>May 02:</strong> Added 50-gallons of fuel, plus fuel stabilizer and octane booster. Tank measured 58 gallons (*).<br><br>(*) A chart was developed to relate the inches of fuel to gallons. A wooden stick is inserted from the top of the fuel tank down to the bottom, and the wet mark is measured. The chart converts the inches to gallons. This is the first time we've been able to accurately gauge remaining fuel as well as consumption rate.<br><br>Performed some switching to get the two cabooses out for next week's National Train Day. Only 30-40 PSI was obtained in the main reservoir, so the compressor has probably failed…again. Used approximately 5 gallons of fuel, mainly due to the heavy load of pulling the Baldwin out of the way.

                                            <strong>January 31:</strong> Rigged up the temporary switches again on the ignition coils, and attempted to adjust each distributor independently. Although a change in the engine's performance could be made, no amount of adjustment would improve the backfiring. Just different, but not better.<br><br>Next removed the valve covers on the right bank, and discovered that one of the pushrods in #2 cylinder was out of proper position (i.e. not in contact with the rocker arm). The pushrod was put back into place with hand pressure, but no loosening or mis-adjustment of the rocker arm could be detected. The suspicion is that the pushrod was pushed out of position by a large backfire, but there is no telling how long it has been that way.<br><br>Barred over the engine by hand, and also with the starter motor: the pushrod held and operated the valve as intended.<br><br>Started the engine again, and it ran somewhat differently (how could it not, now that all valves are working?)

                                            <strong>January 25:</strong> This was the day of our 2009 Annual Picnic and Membership Meeting.

                                            <strong>January 24:</strong> For the generator, the repair shop installed new brushes, bearings and did a thorough cleaning and painting of the housing. Installed the regulator and rebuilt generator, and noted that the system produced a positive voltage, and that the batteries were charging with the engine running. No doubt the repair shop did something else to the generator to reverse its polarity, as the brushes and bearings were probably not responsible. Nevertheless, all the work done to it was probably well overdue.<br><br>Added 2 quarts of oil to the crankcase, and 1 gallon of water to the radiator.

                                            <strong>January 17:</strong> Attempted to 'shock' the generator into reversing its polarity, by briefly connecting the positive battery terminal to the field winding. This was tried several times, but the generator continued to produce a negative voltage. The generator and regulator were removed, to have them checked out at a local automotive electrical shop. Later research revealed that we should have been 'shocking' the armature winding, not the field winding.<br><br>From our friends in Wichita, we learned that they are currently using only one distributor on their Plymouth, and it is running very well that way (their video on YouTube confirms this). Apparently, dual ignition systems like this were, at least in some applications, meant as a back-up, and not necessarily intended to run simultaneously. The LeRoi documentation we have discusses dual ignition systems, but says little about its application or use, except to say that if both systems are used, the spark from each must occur simultaneously.<br><br>As an experiment, some temporary switches were rigged up to control the 12-volt feed to each coil. With the engine running, each distributor in turn was disabled to see its effect on the engine's performance. With one of the ignition systems running, very little difference was observed. With the other system running, the backfiring increased somewhat. Certainly, more work on the ignition system is needed, but this brief experiment does show that the engine does not necessarily need both distributors.

                                            <strong>January 10:</strong> Found the receipt for the battery, and got a no-charge replacement, as it was still under full warranty. Installed the new battery, and noted that the trickle charger was charging all three batteries. The engine started easily.<br><br>However, with the engine running, it was noted that the batteries were not charging. This was traced to the fact that the generator was producing a negative voltage. Fortunately, this condition does no harm, as the isolation diodes prevent any reverse current. It just means the batteries are not charging from the generator, which is not a good situation for any length of time.

Connected the big battery charger for about an hour on its lowest setting, but this also made no improvement on the battery's charge: the only result was the battery getting quite warm. Tested each cell of the battery with the hydrometer: five of the six cells tested from very weak to bad. Also noted that the fluid in several of the cells was rusty-colored. Conclusion: battery is bad, probably from the bad charging that it has experienced lately.<br><br>Removed #2 starting battery from the circuit so that the trickle charger will charge the remaining two batteries. Began the search for the original receipt, so that a credit can be obtained on a replacement battery.

The idea was to drill an additional hole in these plates for the new U-bolts, and then clean and paint them. However, as cleaning of the plates progressed, it was discovered that both of them were cracked. So, new plates will be fabricated: they will include all of the original holes in case the old ignition coils are ever re-mounted.

A new one will have to be obtained or fabricated.<br><br>3) The copper sealing ring for the exhaust valve assembly is nearly gone. A new one will have to be fabricated.<br><br>4) A small section of the valve seat on the exhaust valve assembly is broken away. Being a cast-iron part, repair may be difficult.<br><br>5) The bolt holding together the exhaust valve assembly is worn and needs replacement. The locknut on the current bolt is too short to get a good wrench grip on it. A taller nut or standoff will be used.<br><br>Additionally, it is suspected that the compressor valves may have been improperly re-assembled on the last rebuild. The valve assembly hold-down cages may not have been fully tightened, allowing the valve assemblies to bounce up and down, possibly contributing to some of the above problems. This will be addressed when re-assembling the valves.

Clutch pedal was active at the very top of its travel – adjusting the linkage moved the action down to the middle of the pedal travel. Transmission brake (device that stops the transmission from spinning when shifting) was apparently inoperative, making shifting difficult. Adjusting the brake now stops the transmission at the bottom of the clutch pedal travel. Overall, operating the clutch and shifting the transmission is now easier.

                                            <strong>April 15:</strong> Ron Scofield located a suitable distributor (for a 1972 Chevrolet ½-ton pick-up w/350 cu in V8, to be exact). He modified the drive end of the unit, and it fit perfectly to the Leroi engine. With just one distributor firing only one plug per cylinder, the engine started eagerly and ran better than it has in quite a while. Not bad for only half the ignition system!<br><br>Checked all pushrods and adjusted for proper clearance.<br><br>Ron will proceed with the purchase and modification of a second distributor. With both distributors installed and firing both plugs on each cylinder, the final engine timing can be dialed-in.

                                            <strong>March 19:</strong> Cleaned battery terminals, refilled batteries with distilled water (Thanks, Charlie).

                                            <strong>March 12:</strong> Prepared drawings for distributor wiring and cylinder numbering. Drawings were a great aid in thinking about the complicated ignition, and will be used to document the final version.<br><br>Verified firing order shown in Leroi manual. Found more loose pushrod ends on cylinders 1 – 2.<br><br>Distributors have dual points, a four-lobe cam, and a two-ended rotor. Firing occurs on alternating points, (4 lobes x 2 points = 8 hits). Concluded, after much experimentation, adjustment, etc. that distributor caps are no good. Since replacement caps are not available (?), a search for new distributors will commence. Criteria: adaptable to existing mounting and drive on engine, 8-cylinder with single points and 8-lobe cam.

                                            <strong>March 5:</strong> Organized Plymouth and Leroi documents received from George Holt. "Originals" will be kept in museum files, and where pertinent, copies will be made for shop use.<br><br>Installed reconditioned air compressor unloader pilot valve. Testing will have to wait until engine is running properly.<br><br>Traced sparkplug wiring and made drawing of current configuration. Confirmed that left distributor controls head sparkplugs (outside of 'V'), and that right distributor controls block sparkplugs (inside of 'V'). However, neither distributor was wired in the published firing order of the engine, nor were the two distributors wired the same as each other.<br><br>Removed valve cover on cylinders 3R/4R, and discovered that the cupped fittings on both pushrod ends had become detached on cylinder 3R (and therefore the valves on that cylinder were inoperative). No idea how this could have happened – reattached fittings and adjusted valves.<br><br>Observations from today lead to amazement that the engine ever ran at all. Before any rewiring of the distributors commences, the firing order will be verified experimentally (rather than trusting the Leroi manual).

                                            <strong>February 26:</strong> Began process of analyzing ignition system. All four coils and points seem to work okay, but serious degradation of the distributor caps was observed (this is not new information – caps have been in bad shape for some time, with previous repairs attempted using epoxy potting compound).<br><br>During this process, the engine timing was disturbed to the point that the engine now won't start.

This indicates that crankcase water is due to condensation only, and is not caused by a coolant leak.<br><br>Cleaned 16 sparkplugs with pneumatic abrasive device. On five cylinders, both plugs of each cylinder were dry, with only a moderate amount of carbon build-up. However, on the three other cylinders, both sparkplugs of each cylinder were wet with fuel, with very little carbon. This would indicate that those three cylinders have been firing very little if at all. These 'bad' cylinders were 3L, 3R, and 4R.<br><br>NOTE: this logbook conforms to the Leroi Engine Manual's convention of looking from the gear-end (front) of the engine to identify left/right, with cylinder numbering starting from the front.<br><br>Inspected oil-bath air cleaner.
